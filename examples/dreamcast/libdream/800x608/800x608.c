/* This sample program shows off 800x608, the mythical "unsupported" video
   mode that Sega will probably complain doesn't work (like they did for
   our 320x240 modes earlier on ;-). This will probably only work on a VGA
   monitor and I highly recommend that you don't try it on a non-multisync.
   Still needs some tweaking.

   In here I also demonstrate how to use the bfont BIOS font routines, and
   how to initialize only selected parts of KOS (resulting in a much
   smaller and less polluted binary).
