/* Real-Time Clock (RTC) support

   The functions in here return various info about the real-world time and
   date stored in the machine. The general process here is to retrieve
   the date/time value and then use the other functions to interpret it.

   rtc_get_time() should return a UNIX-epoch time stamp, and then the normal
   BSD library functions can be used to interpret that time stamp.

   For the Dreamcast, the RTC is a 32-bit seconds counter located at
   0xa0710000 and 0xa0710004 (each 32-bits long). 0000 contains the high
   16 bits and 0004 contains the low 16 bits. The epoch of this counter is
   January 1, 1950, 00:00. So we just grab that value and add about
   20 years to it.
